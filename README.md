# mcmc-substutition
Decoding bijective permutations of text (substitution ciphers) using Monte Carlo Markov Chains w/ Metropolis Hastings sampling.

This isn't really optimized to let others clone and run on their computers but if you do want to try it out:

1. `git clone` the repo, then `cd` into it
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Change the file constants inside of `main.py` if desired
4. Then, do `python main.py` and it will run.
